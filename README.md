# 2d-collision-simulation

A simple, non deterministic Java application that simulates 2D ball collisions with gravity, friction, and wall boundaries using Swing for visualization.

### Running the Simulation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Run the `Main` class (`src/Main.java`).

The simulation window will open and display moving balls.

## Project Structure

- `Main.java` ‚Äî Entry point, sets up the window and simulation loop
- `Ball.java` ‚Äî Ball properties and physics update logic
- `PhysicsEngine.java` ‚Äî Handles physics, collisions, and simulation steps
- `SimulationPanel.java` ‚Äî Renders the balls using Swing

## Customization

- Add or remove balls in `Main.java`
- Adjust gravity, friction, or ball properties in `Ball.java`
